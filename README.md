Suppose k PCs are selected in your PCA for the SP  data. It means ith stock will have coordinates pi1, pi2 · · · pik in the subspace spanned by PCs. 



– 1. find the top 20 stocks with largest PC1 values 
– 2. find the top 20 stocks with largest PC2 values
– 3. Find the top 20 stocks with largest PCk values 
– 4. RankeachstockbytheirPCArankingscoreρ= p2i1 +p2i2 +···+p2ik, list the top-ranked 20 stocks, and describe their characteristics. 
– 5. Discuss the relationships between the variables according to your PCA analysis
